**Todo
Change antinoob's spawn protection system to an editable entity. Will allow for instant prop removal and no more looping through a sphere.
I think prop dormancy voting function was messed up? But I don't remember how
Add another statistic for total battles fought if it doesn't already exist
Add config for server owners to let players create their own bot paths
(?) Add option to scoreboard to view a player's achievements
(?) Keep tracking player achievement data even after unlocking. Can later review to see total headsmashes etc
Eventually only network TopPropsTotal that has CHANGED from last time instead of sending the whole table
(?) Add Top Players leaderboard menu. Can show stuff like "Most kills", "Most Battles", "Most Battles Won", "Highest KD",
    "Most Hours Played", "First to complete all achievements"
Add color schemes to client config
HUD doesn't show for resized scerens? E.g 1920x1200 the HUD isnt showing..
    > I think this has something to with our new config setting to change HUD positions

**Notes
The gamemode is messy and I'm probably not going to do anything about it..
No I'm not returning. I just felt like revisiting this project to fix some things.
Thank you for running the gamemode to this day. It means a lot.
