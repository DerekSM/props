**Todo
Change antinoob's spawn protection system to an editable entity. Will allow for instant prop removal and no more looping through a sphere.
I think prop dormancy voting function was messed up? But I don't remember how
Add another statistic for total battles fought if it doesn't already exist
Add config for server owners to let players create their own bot paths


**Notes
The gamemode is messy and I'm probably not going to do anything about it..
No I'm not returning. I just felt like revisiting this project to fix some things.
Thank you for running the gamemode to this day. It means a lot.
