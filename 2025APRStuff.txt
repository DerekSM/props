**Changelog
v1.2.1:
/ The default weapon selection HUD will now show if you have a toolgun.
/ Miscellaneous micro optimisations and fixes.
/ Dead players and spectators can't spawn ragdolls anymore even if ragdolls are enabled.
/ Fixed player team switch delay. It was doubling whatever time restriction we had.
+ Readded bot modules. Apparently they were still used for aim training.
v1.2:
/ Switched NetVar's to NW2 library. I don't know if NetVar was an old way of networking or what but it was broken.
/ Fixed some HUD errors
- Removed bot modules. I don't think they were used and even if they were it was always buggy.
- Removed some abusable debugging commands
/ Fixed clientside muting (gagging) on scoreboard
+ Added new player info copy to scoreboard
/ Fixed killing spree sounds and made them easier to find to add more.
+ Added more server config options
/ Fixed chat sounds module, and added more sounds
+ Added statistics module. Gamemode statistics will report in chatbox.
+ Added ability to save gamemode config options across restarts

**Todo
Change antinoob's spawn protection system to an editable entity. Will allow for instant prop removal and no more looping through a sphere.
Let players use alternate scoreboard (i.e a single scoreboard) in f4 menu
Let players change HUD positions in f4 menu
Let players change chat sound options in f4 menu
Cleanup DoPlayerDeath
I think prop dormancy voting function was messed up? But I don't remember how
Add another statistic for total battles fought if it doesn't already exist
Allow recent battle list to be interactive: Let players right click to view time and player information in detail.
Add config for server owners to let players create their own bot paths


**Notes
The gamemode is messy and I'm probably not going to do anything about it..
No I'm not returning. I just felt like revisiting this project to fix some things.
Thank you for running the gamemode to this day. It means a lot.
