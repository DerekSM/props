instead of "Time Limit" (which is a bitch to implement or something, idk it hasnt been done yet!)
	do.. "Prop Limit" for the battling, minimum 1 prop, maximum 5

have a checkbox toggle for a  "fun" fight

record how long it took the fight to finish

add pause for players in fight
	each player gets 3 pauses per fight, pause lasts 20 seconds
	during pause nobody can spawn props
	
			DONE ?
	
if a player d/c (potential game crash or internet connection loss) during a fight
	within 3 minutes, let them resume their fight


for SANDOBX SERVER:
	have a dedicated spot in skybox for builders:
		anti noclip surrinding the "gm_spawn models/hunter/plates/plate32x32.mdl"
		, players can invite one other person to be in there with them

		if they abuse it like fuck with others while in trusted position, they get keys rebinded

	have players claim they can crash server with button?
	if it succeeds, they get a hat from pointshop. to show all that they can crash a server. yipee

	have a 3d2d text over peoples heads showing if they have godmode or not
	
	have 2 modes - peace mode and war mode
		peace has lower chance of losing godmode by chance
			cant spawn great npcs
			cant spawn flying npcs ( helis, dropships )
			
		war has the same chance as before of losing godmode
			can dothe regular shit
			
		each mode lasts 30 minutes
		
	
	instead of those 2 modes:
		
		
	have a mazelike structure in skybox (made with unbreakable wooden crates)
		players may opt in at any time but there has to be at least 2 (3?) to participate
		and max of 4 players (they all start at a seperate corner)
			there will be scoreboard for all players attending
				first person to 3 kills (5 if there's 4 players)  ?
				OR
				last man standing
				
				OR 
				have server advertise which one its doing at the moment
