instead of "Time Limit" (which is a bitch to implement or something, idk it hasnt been done yet!)
	do.. "Prop Limit" for the battling, minimum 1 prop, maximum 5

have a checkbox toggle for a  "fun" fight


for SANDOBX SERVER:
	have a dedicated spot in skybox for builders:
		anti noclip surrinding the "gm_spawn models/hunter/plates/plate32x32.mdl"
		, players can invite one other person to be in there with them

		if they abuse it like fuck with others while in trusted position, they get keys rebinded

	have players claim they can crash server with button?
	if it succeeds, they get a hat from pointshop. to show all that they can crash a server. yipee
